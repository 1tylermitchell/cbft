# Overview

cbft is a full-text indexing server for documents that you've created
and stored into a Couchbase bucket.  The full-text indexes that cbft
manages can be automatically distributed across multiple, clustered
cbft server processes to allow for larger indexes and for higher
performance.

# Getting started
