<h1 id="managing-cbft">Managing cbft</h1>
<p>This document talks about the "levers and toggles" available to manage
cbft indexes and cbft nodes.</p>
<h1 id="managing-cbft-indexes">Managing cbft indexes</h1>
<h2 id="index-building">Index building</h2>
<p>Index building is the process by which cbft sets up connections to
data sources, retrieves data from the data sources, analyzes that
data, and updates index data in memory and in persisted storage, in
concurrent fashion.</p>
<p>By concurrent, we mean that cbft uses internal pipelines or data
streams, as opposed to, for example, completely retrieving all the
data from a data source as one phase before starting any analysis
phase.  Instead, cbft's approach allows for incremental processing,
which is suited to also handle updates or mutations of data from the
data source over time.</p>
<p>cbft will automatically start its concurrent index building steps as
soon as you create an index.</p>
<p>During the index building phase, the index is queryable.  However,
cbft may not have processed or ingested all the data for the index, of
course, from its data source yet.  In this case, queries will return
responses for the data so far incorporated in a "best effort" fashion.</p>
<p>If a cbft node has to restart in the midst of index building, the
restarted cbft will attempt to "pick up where it left off" on its
indexing activites, as much as possible and if the data source allows
for restartability of data streams.</p>
<p>The <code>couchbase</code> data source type, of note, allows for
restartability of data streams.</p>
<h2 id="rebuilding-indexes">Rebuilding indexes</h2>
<p>Sometimes, an administrator wishes to rebuild an index from scratch,
or as is sometimes described, "rebuilding an index from zero" or "from
scratch" (in reference to an empty start condition and/or to a 0
sequence number or very beginning of a sequence of data).</p>
<p>To rebuild an index from scratch in cbft, using your web browser in
the web admin UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navgiate to the <code>Indexes</code> page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the row for the index you wish to rebuild.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On that same row, click on the <code>edit</code> button, where you'll next
  see an edit form for your index definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: you can make changes to your index definition at this
  point, but you do not need to do just to get a rebuild.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <code>Update Index</code> button at the bottom of the form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your index will start rebuilding from scratch or from zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you had made changes to your index definition, your new index
  will reflect your index definition changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of note, the index UUID will change as part of this operation, which
allows applications to detect that the index definition has "changed".
This may be important for some applications that are caching results,
etc.</p>
<h2 id="disablingenabling-indexing">Disabling/enabling indexing</h2>
<p>Sometimes, an administrator needs to pause index maintenance or
ingest.  For example, perhaps during key hours of heavy traffic, the
administrator would like to dedicate more resources to query
performance, at the cost of an out of date index.</p>
<p>To pause index ingest activities, in the web admin UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the <code>Indexes</code> page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the index name link for the index whose ingest you wish to
  pause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <code>Manage</code> tab for your index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <code>Disable Ingest</code> button.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Index Ingest</code> state will turn from <code>enabled</code> to
<code>disabled</code>, and the button you just clicked will turn into an
<code>Enable Ingest</code> button.</p>
<p>To re-enable index processing and data ingest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <code>Enable Ingest</code> button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: if index ingest is disabled or paused, and your application is
querying the index and is specifying optional consistency parameters
(it is trying to "read its own writes") those queries will be paused
until the index ingest is re-enabled and the index has ingested all
the data up to the required consistency point.  This can lead to
apparently slow application behavior and application timeouts.</p>
<h2 id="disablingenabling-queries">Disabling/enabling queries</h2>
<p>Sometimes, an administrator needs to temporarily disable the ability
for applications to make queries on an index.  For example, perhaps
during some 2:00AM hours of maintenance time, the administrator would
like the index ingest to "catch up" to the most recent data source
mutations.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, the administrator would like to rebuild indexes from
scratch at this point.</p>
<p>In any case, by disabling queries, the administrator can help ensure
more resources will be used for index ingest processing.  That is, a
slow, massive query might take resources away from the main priority
of getting the index up to date, so pausing index query'ability can be
a useful feature.</p>
<p>To disable index query'ability, in the web admin UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the <code>Indexes</code> page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the index name link for the index whose querying you wish
  to disable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <code>Manage</code> tab for your index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <code>Disable Queries</code> button.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Index Queries</code> state will turn from <code>enabled</code> to
<code>disabled</code>, and the button you just clicked will turn into an
<code>Enable Queries</code> button.</p>
<p>At this time, applications sending new query requests for your index
will receive error responses.</p>
<p>To re-enable queries on your index:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <code>Enable Queries</code> button.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disablingenabling-partition-reassignments">Disabling/enabling partition reassignments</h2>
<p>Normally, as cbft nodes are added or removed from a cbft cluster, the
cbft system automatically rebalances and reassigns index partitions to
the remaining nodes in the cluster.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an administrator needs to disable this automatic index
partition reassignment, on a per index basis, because reassigned index
partitions need to go through index building, and any queries during
an index rebuild will see only the responses for data that have been
indexed so far.</p>
<p>To disable index parittion reassignments, in the web admin UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the <code>Indexes</code> page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the index name link for the index whose index partitions
  you wish to to have reassignments disabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <code>Manage</code> tab for your index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <code>Disable Reassignments</code> button.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Index Partition Reassignments</code> state will turn from
<code>enabled</code> to <code>disabled</code>, and the button you just clicked will
turn into an <code>Enable Reassignments</code> button.</p>
<p>At this time, any cluster membership changes (cbft nodes added or
removed) will not trigger an automatic index partitions reassignment
for your index.</p>
<p>To re-enable index partition reassignments on your index:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <code>Enable Reassignments</code> button.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="index-definition-changes-and-zero-downtime">Index definition changes and zero downtime</h2>
<p>When an index definition is created or modified, cbft will rebuild the
 index from scratch, starting from an empty state for that index.</p>
<p>During that time, queries against a modified index can see "missing"
results, as an index rebuild can take time to ingest or process data
from the data source.</p>
<p>To alleviate this situation and have "zero downtime" with respect to
query'ability, a user can utilize cbft's index alias feature.</p>
<p>The idea is to leverage the level of indirection in naming that an
alias provides, where an application sends its queries to an index
alias instead of directly to real indexes.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine the user creates a real index definition, such
as for <code>ProductCatalogIndex-01</code>.</p>
<p>Then the user also creates an index alias, called
<code>ProductCatalogAlias</code>, which has <code>ProductCatalogIndex-01</code> as
its target.</p>
<p>The user's application is configured to make queries against
<code>ProductCatalogAlias</code>, and everything works fine.</p>
<p>Some time later, however, the team discovers a need for additional
features, such as perhaps needing to adjust bleve's full-text
tokenization configuration to improve its search results relevancy.</p>
<p>Rather than directly editing the <code>ProductCatalogIndex-01</code>, instead
the team creates a brand new index, <code>ProductCatalogIndex-02</code>,
which has the improved index configuration.</p>
<p>The team lets <code>ProductCatalogIndex-02</code> index build up to
acceptable amount of data.</p>
<p>The team may also, optionally, wish to turn off indexing ingest for
<code>ProductCatalogIndex-01</code>, if application requirements allow for
some amount of stale'ness in indexes.</p>
<p>When <code>ProductCatalogIndex-02</code> is ready, the team edits the
<code>ProductCatalogAlias</code> definition to point to
<code>ProductCatalogIndex-02</code> instead of pointing to the previous
<code>ProductCatalogIndex-01</code>.</p>
<p>The application continues to query <code>ProductCatalogAlias</code> with no
apparent downtime of queries.</p>
<p>As an advanced approach, the team may also allow some subset of the
application or subset of users (e.g., "beta" users) to instead query
the <code>ProductCatalogIndex-02</code>, even while it is building up, in
order to get a preview of the changed index configuration's behavior.</p>
<p>The resource cost of using an index alias for zero downtime to queries
is double that of a single index, but some applications may have zero
downtime as a necessary requirement for production and are willing to
bear the extra cost.</p>
<h2 id="nodecluster-changes-and-zero-downtime">Node/cluster changes and zero downtime</h2>
<p>Similar to with handling index definition changes with zero downtime,
an administrator can use index aliases in order to provide zero
downtime for application queries even as cluster membership changes
(cbft nodes are added or removed).</p>
<p>Normally, as nodes are added or removed from a cbft cluster (as
different cbft nodes are registered as wanted or unwanted or unknown),
the cbft system will automatically reassign index partitions amongst
the remaining nodes.  The reassigned index partitions need to be built
up from scratch, however, which leads to queries not providing
responses to all data as the reassigned index partitions are being
built.</p>
<p>The solution is to use an index alias so that applications can
continue to query the old index.</p>
<p>Additionally, <em>before</em> the administrator adds or removes nodes from a
cbft cluster, the administrator should disable index partition
reassignments for the current index definition.</p>
<p>Please see the instructions above for how to disable index partition
reassignments for an index.</p>
<p>Then, the administrator can add new cbft nodes, and the current index
definition will remain "stable", where its index partitions will
remain assigned to the set of old cbft nodes.</p>
<p>The administrator would next define a new index, where the index
partitions of the new index would be assigned to both the old,
remaining cbft nodes and also to the newly added cbft nodes.</p>
<p>The administrator would then monitor the cbft cluster, watching for
indexing and ingest progress on the new index.</p>
<p>When the new index has indexed or ingested enough data from the data
source, the administrator can then edit the index alias and repoint
the index alias away from the old index definition and instead point
the index alias to the new index definition.</p>
<p>Then the administrator can delete the old index definition.</p>
<p>This operation allows applications to query the index alias with no
loss of indexed data, but at the cost of requiring twice the resources
to temporarily support two indexes in a cluster.</p>

<p>TBD</p>
<h2 id="compacting-data">Compacting data</h2>
<p>TBD</p>
<h2 id="backup-and-restore">Backup and restore</h2>
<p>cbft includes various REST API endpoints to be able request the cbft
cluster's current configuration and index definitions, which can be
used for restoration purposes.</p>
<p>The Cfg provider (i.e., a Couchbase <code>my-cfg-bucket</code>) should also
have replication enabled and be backed up for production usage.</p>
<p>Because cbft is used as an indexing server, the index data entries
maintained by cbft should also be able to be rebuilt "from scratch",
at the cost of rebuild time, from the original "source of truth" data
sources.</p>
<p>At root, though, the end-all/be-all safety net and recommended
practice is that cbft index creation scripts should be checked into
source-code control systems so that any development, test or
administration colleagues on the application's team can replicate a
cbft configuration at will.</p>

<p>The <code>Nodes</code> screen in cbft's web admin UI shows a list of all the
cbft nodes in a cbft cluster.</p>
<p>Detailed information with you click on any particular cbft node link
includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the cbft node's version number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the cbft node's UUID or <code>cbft.uuid</code></p>
</li>

<h2 id="forcing-a-manager-kick">Forcing a manager kick</h2>
<p>A button to <code>Kick Manager</code> is available in the web admin UI, on
the <code>Manage</code> page.  Clicking it forces the cbft node to re-run its
management activities, which include re-partitioning indexes into
index partitions and re-assigning index partitions to nodes in the
cluster.</p>
<p>Of note, if the nodes and index definitions in a cluster have not
changed, then the re-paritioning and re-assignment activities of a
manager kick should result in the exact same "plan"; hence, a manager
kick in that case would result effectively with nothing changing.</p>
<p>An optional <code>Kick Message</code> input field allows the user to provide
text that will be logged by the cbft node, so that an administrator
can correlate manager kick requests with server-side logs.</p>
